# Front-End Challenges
In this repository, I replicate designs from frontendmentor.io. I have hosted the completed designs on netlify. The links are attached:

## Notifications Menu:

The Notifications menu displays a list of notifications for the user. The UI includes an active state, inactive state. The design is also responsive. <br>

## Profile Widget:

The profile widget is similar to the UI the user views when they click on their profile menu. The widget includes a centered image and the user's info. The design is also responsive and mobile-friendly. <br>
